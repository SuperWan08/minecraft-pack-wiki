# Resource Packs

The resource pack system allows players to easily modify textures, models, music, sounds, languages, and various in-game texts like the end poem, splashes, credits, and fonts. 

The best part is that these customizations can be made **without the need for any code modification.**

This significantly lowers the barrier-to-entry of modifying the game, but can also be more limiting than using a mod loader such as [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) or [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/).

## What can you actually do though?

This is a full list of things that are exposed to you through the resource pack system:

- Languages/Translations
- Entity models
- Block models
- Item models
- Blockstates
- Textures and Texture Sheets
- Atlases
- Animations
- Color Maps
- Text Objects
- Fonts
- Shaders (GLSL)
